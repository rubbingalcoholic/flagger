Flagger
==========================================
#### Browser add-on for Firefox and Chrome

Introduction
------------
Flagger is a browser add-on that automatically puts red flag keywords (like
_bomb_, _Taliban_ and _anthrax_) into the web addresses you visit. Install
Flagger and help us send a message: _government surveillance has gone too far._

Flagger is licensed under version 3 the [GNU General Public License][1] as
published by the Free Software Foundation.

This source code is for both Firefox and Chrome. The vast majority of the
source files are the same across both browsers. Any browser-specific files are
loaded in via the manifest.json file (for Chrome) or the Firefox Add-on SDK.
